This project simulates an airline booking system where users can select flights, 
choose the number of seats, and specify the class. 

Developed using ASP.NET Web Application with the MVC architecture, 
it utilizes Microsoft SQL Server 2022 and SSMS for database management. 
Users can register, fill in passenger details, and make payments, 
with the option to save their credit card information for future purchases. 

After completing the payment, the system generates flight tickets, 
which users can view, save, or print.
